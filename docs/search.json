    "section": "",
    "text": "R is an open-source programming language for statistical computing and graphics. R is extensible, and has a large collection of high-quality user contributed packages that provides easy tools for common data analysis tasks.\nIn this workshop we will learn ggplot2, a powerful R package for visualization.\n\n“ggplot2 is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.” – ggplot2 document\n\n\n\nWhat To Prepare\nPlease install R and RStudio Desktop before the first session.\nIf you encounter technical difficulties installing the software, you can instead create a free RStudio Cloud account so you can run R in the cloud via your browser.\nAn alternative to RStudio Cloud is the UofT JupyterHub/RStudio system. Go to its home page, choose the RStudio option, and click Log in to start. You will need your UTORid to login.\n\n\n\nWorkshop Materials\n\nSlide\nNotebook: \nReading: Section Visualize (Chapter 10, 11, and 12) in R for Data Science (2e)\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nLearning\n\nR Graphics Cookbook\nggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis\nThe R Graph Gallery\nggplot2 Cheat Sheets (cheat sheets for many popular R packages)\n\nInspiration\n\nTanya Shapiro’s GitHub Gallery\nFronkonstin\nData Imaginist\n\n\n\nBack to TDMDAL Computing Page"
